    "In this tutorial, we show how to use a built-in `Transformation` `AddSum` and define our own `Transformation` `BreadWordSwap`. You also learned how to control the number of transformed words. In fact, you may also find that replacing three words in `BreadWordSwap` makes the result sample meaningless and hard-to-read. Our next section will show you how to use `Validator` to filter out sample that are useless. "
